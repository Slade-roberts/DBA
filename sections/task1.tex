\chapter{Task 1: ER Diagram for NPSS Database}

The goal of this task was to make an ER diagram for the NPSS (National Park Support System) database.  
The diagram shows all of the main parts of the system, how they connect, and the important information stored about each one.

\end{figure}

The ER diagram includes people, visitors, rangers, researchers, and national parks.  
It also shows programs, teams, projects, and donations.  
Each line between the boxes represents a relationship between entities, such as which ranger is part of a team or which visitor joins a program.

Some notes about the design:
\begin{itemize}
    \item People can have multiple phone numbers and emails.
    \item Rangers can be assigned to teams and can have many certifications.
    \item Researchers oversee ranger teams and write reports.
    \item Visitors can enroll in different park programs.
    \item Donations can be made by donors using checks or credit cards.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the ER diagram shows how the NPSS database keeps track of all the people, parks, and activities in one connected system.
